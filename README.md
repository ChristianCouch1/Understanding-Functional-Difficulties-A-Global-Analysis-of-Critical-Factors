# Overview
​This research examines key factors that predict whether individuals from different countries experience functional difficulties. It focuses on the type of ANSR (Adjusted Net Attendance Rate), foundational reading test scores, foundational numeracy scores, and sex. This study​ employs logistic regression and a Random Forest classifier on a dataset from UNICEF's Global  Database on Education for Children with Disabilities. The approach aims to identify differences between individuals with and without functional difficulties and assess whether a significant gap exists in these skills.​
