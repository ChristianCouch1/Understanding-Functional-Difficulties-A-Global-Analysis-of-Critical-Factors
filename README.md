# Background
This project was completed for my Senior Project/Portfolio class. It focuses on understanding the key factors that predict whether individuals from different countries experience functional difficulties. Using data from UNICEF's Global Database on Education for Children with Disabilities, the study explores how education and demographic factors may relate to functional challenges.

# Overview
This research investigates the key predictors of functional difficulties among individuals across different countries. Specifically, it analyzes the impact of Adjusted Net Attendance Rate (ANSR), foundational reading test scores, foundational numeracy scores, and sex. Logistic regression and a Random Forest classifier are applied to the UNICEF dataset to distinguish between individuals with and without functional difficulties and to evaluate the extent of any skill gaps.
